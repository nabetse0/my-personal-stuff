## Ingredient Summary

### Wet Ingredients
- 320 g brown sugar
- 1/2 cup toasted butter

butter are combined into the "butter mixture" (see below).

- 28 g corn starch
- 10 g salt
- 6 g baking soda

### The Mixins
- 360 g chocolate chopped up into bits

## Making the Butter Mixture

Heat 1/2 cup of salted butter in a small sauce pan on medium low
heat. You'll have to monitor the butter as it heats up. If it starts
spitting, lower the heat accordingly. The goal is to heat the butter
to the point where the milk solids just start to toast. After you take
the butter off the heat, it'll continue to toast in the residual
heat. So, you'll want to remove the butter from heat as soon as you
see the milk solids start to change color.

As the butter heats up, it'll foam twice: 

As the cream separates from the butter fat, the first foam will appear
as a thick floating bubbly mass. This will get thicker as water
evaporates. Eventually, the foam will disperse into the butter fat as
it continues to fry in the butter fat.

The butter will begin to foam again as the temperature of the butter
fat continues to rise. The bubbles will initially be large but will
gradually get finer. You may need to adjust the heat to prevent the
foam from boiling over. As the bubbles get really fine, you may need
to stir or swirl the contents of the pan to check for browning milk
solids. As soon as you start to see tan milk solid break though the
layer of foam, take the butter off the heat.


## Baking
