# Soft shortbread cookies

Shortbread with different flour-butter-sugar proportions yielding a chewier texture. 

## Ingredient Summary

### Wet Ingredients
- 1 cup granulated white sugar
- 1 cup toasted butter (see recipe for toasted butter)
- 1 egg (for dough)


### Dry Ingredients
- 1/2 cup corn starch
- 2 cups all purpose flour 

### For After Baking
- egg wash

## Combining Wet Ingredients

- 1 cup granulated white sugar
- 1 cup toasted butter (see recipe for toasted butter)
- 1 egg

First, make sure the toasted butter has cooled down to near room temperature. It should still be liquid. 

Add the sugar and mix until itâ€™s pretty homogenous. Add the egg and beat until the liquid is thick and smooth. An electric mixer makes this much easier. 

## Adding Dry Ingredients

Start adding the corn starch a little at a time beating the mixture until smooth. Once all the corn starch has been incorporated, start adding the flour also in small batches. 

At some point, the dough will get too thick to mix with a whisk or electric mixer. When this happens, switch to folding in the rest of the flour with a spatula. 

## Resting 

After the dough is well mixed, let it rest at least for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
